## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# What else can we do?

Up until now, the file you have seen was automatically generated to introduce RMarkdown. Now I will show you some examples of useful features you can use for your team assignment.

## Using  $LaTeX$ for mathematical notation

One of the things that R Markdown can do is use $LaTeX$, a software system for document preparation which, among other things, allows us to write mathematical notation in a neat format. In order for this to work, you will need to have a $LaTeX$ distribution installed. I recommend $TinyTeX$. See <https://yihui.org/tinytex/> for more details and how to install. An alternative option is $MiKTeX$ (see <https://miktex.org/>) which offers a more complete version but doesn't integreat as neatly with R Markdown and R Studio (so I don't recommend it unless you need to do something very complex),

The dedicated page _Useful R/ RStudio/ RMarkdown resources_ on Moodle (<https://moodle.unive.it/mod/page/view.php?id=539511>) contains links to useful manuals and cheat-sheets for R, R Markdown and $LaTeX$.

## Example: an exam-type exercise

$11\%$ of the microchips used by a computer assembly company is produced by Supplier A and the remaining $89\%$ by Supplier B. The weight of the microchips produced by Supplier A follows a normal distribution with mean $\mu=4.3$g. and variance $\sigma^2=0.16^2$g. The weight of the microchips produced by Supplier B is uniformly distributed between $4.1$g and $4.5$g.

a. What is the probability that a microchip from Supplier A has a weight between $4.1$g and $4.4$g?
b. What is the probability that a microchip from Supplier B has a weight between $4.1$g and $4.4$g?
c. What is the probability that a randomly chosen microchip has a weight between $4.1$g and $4.4$g?
d. If a microchip used by the assembly company weights between $4.1$g. and $4.4$g, what is the probability that it comes from Supplier A?

_Solution:_

Define the following events:

* $G= \{\text{ The microchip weights between } 4.1 \text{g. and } 4.4 \text{g}.\}$
* $A= \{\text{ The microchip was produced by Supplier A} \}$.
* $B= \{\text{ The microchip was produced by Supplier B}\}$.

a. Let $X$ be the weight of a microchip produced by Supplier A. Then, $X\sim\text{N}(4.3, 0.16^2)$, and
$$\mathbb P[G|A]=\mathbb P[4.1<X<4.4]=\mathrm{ pnorm(4.4,4.3,0.16)-pnorm(4.1,4.3,0.16) } =`r round(pnorm(4.4,4.3,0.16)-pnorm(4.1,4.3,0.16),4)`$$
A less nicely formatted (ugly-looking) solution:
```{r}
pnorm(4.4,4.3,0.16)-pnorm(4.1,4.3,0.16)
```

b. Let $Y$ be the weight of a microchip produced by Supplier B. Then, $Y\sim\text{U}(4.1, 4.5)$, and
$$\mathbb P[G|B]=\mathbb P[4.1<Y<4.4]=\mathrm{ punif(4.4,4.1,4.5)-punif(4.1,4.1,4.5) } =`r round(punif(4.4,4.1,4.5)-punif(4.1,4.1,4.5),4)`$$
Alternatively, 
$\mathbb P[4.1<Y<4.4]= (4.4-4.1)/(4.5-4.1) =`r round((4.4-4.1)/(4.5-4.1),4)`$.

A less nicely formatted (ugly-looking) solution:
```{r}
punif(4.4,4.1,4.5)-punif(4.1,4.1,4.5)
```

Or:
```{r}
(4.4-4.1)/(4.5-4.1)
```

c. By the law of total probability, $$\mathbb P[G]= \mathbb P[A]P[G|A]+ \mathbb P[B]\mathbb P[B|A]=0.11\cdot `r round(pnorm(4.4,4.3,0.16)-pnorm(4.1,4.3,0.16),4)`+(1-0.11)\cdot `r round(punif(4.4,4.1,4.5)-punif(4.1,4.1,4.5),4)`= `r round(0.11* (pnorm(4.4,4.3,0.16)-pnorm(4.1,4.3,0.16)) + (1-0.11)* (punif(4.4,4.1,4.5)-punif(4.1,4.1,4.5)),4)`$$

Alternatively, we define some quantities (hidden from the report) and use them to abbreviate the answers:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sol_a <- pnorm(4.4,4.3,0.16)-pnorm(4.1,4.3,0.16)
sol_b <- punif(4.4,4.1,4.5)-punif(4.1,4.1,4.5)
sol_c <- 0.11*sol_a + (1-0.11)*sol_b
```
$$\mathbb P[G]= \mathbb P[A]P[G|A]+ \mathbb P[B]\mathbb P[B|A]=0.11\cdot `r round(sol_a,4)`+(1-0.11)\cdot `r round(sol_b,4)`= `r round(sol_c,4)`$$

d. By the Bayes rule,
```{r, echo=FALSE}
sol_d <- 0.11*sol_a / sol_c
```
$$\mathbb P[A|G]=\frac{\mathbb P[A]P[G|A]}{\mathbb P[G]}= \frac{0.11\cdot `r round(sol_a,4)`}{`r round(sol_c,4)`}=`r round(sol_d,4)`$$
