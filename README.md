### 1. Poker Dice Probabilities 🎲

- Simulate probabilities for poker dice outcomes.
  - **(a)** P(no two alike) = 0.0926
  - **(b)** P(one pair) = 0.4630
  - **(c)** P(two pairs) = 0.2315
  - **(d)** P(three alike) = 0.1543
  - **(e)** P(full house) = 0.0386
  - **(f)** P(four alike) = 0.0193
  - **(g)** P(five alike) = 0.0008

### 2. Card Dealing Probabilities 💸

- Calculate the probability of specific outcomes in card dealing.
  - **Exercise 1:** What is the probability that the 14th card dealt is an ace?
  - **Exercise 2:** What is the probability that the first ace occurs on the 14th card?

### 3. Hidden Present Problem 🎁

- Given probabilistic information on where parents hide a present, solve:
  - (a) Probability that the present is upstairs.
  - (b) Given it is downstairs, probability it was hidden by dad.

### 4. Genetics and Probability 🐭

- Solve genetics problems related to dominance:
  - (a) Probability of a black rat being pure black given a brown sibling.
  - (b) Probability a rat is pure black given all 5 offspring with a brown rat are black.

### 5. Coin Toss Differences ✏️

- For a coin tossed `n` times, compute:
  - Possible values of X, the difference between the number of heads and tails.

### 6. Hurricane Probabilities 🌬

- Analyze hurricane occurrences:
  - **Exercise 1:** Probability of 3 or fewer hurricanes in a year (Poisson process).

### 7. Uniform Distribution and Density 📌

- Uniform random variables:
  - (a) Joint density of U = X, V = X + Y.
  - (b) Density function of V from part (a).

### 8. Normal Distribution Problems ❓

- Normal random variables:
  - (a) Probability that IQ > 125 (mean = 100, SD = 15).
  - (b) Probability that IQ is between 90 and 110.

### 9. Gross Sales Analysis 💰

- Analyze gross weekly sales at a restaurant:
  - (a) Probability total sales over 2 weeks exceed $5000.
  - (b) Probability weekly sales exceed $2000 in at least 2 of the next 3 weeks.
  - Independence assumptions made during analysis.

### 10. Joint Density and Variance 💪

- For independent uniform (0, 1) variables X and Y:
  - (a) Find the joint density of U = X, V = X + Y.
  - (b) Compute the variance of the sum of the rolls for 10 dice.
